#Timeâ€”50%: Did you spend at least three hours on your Python program or test functions during the current lesson? Yes
#Is your program organized into multiple functions? Yes
#Does each function in your program perform just one task? Yes, after showing the complex equation, the program asks if the user wants to compute again.
#Did you complete some significant part of your program during the current week? Yes, the code above is the first part of my project.
#A list of the function names in your program: I used the main function and the refeat function, both with def. 
#A list of the test function names in your test code: I've used the function below:
#def test_number():
#    data = np.arange(8) + 1j*np.arange(2, 10)
#   x = data.real 
#    y = data.imag
#   plt.plot(x, y, '-.r*') 
#    plt.ylabel('Imaginary') 
#    plt.xlabel('Real') 
#    plt.show()

# A description or list of the work that you finished on your program : my program is based on operations with complex numbers.
# A complex number is followed by a letter, more specifically, the letter j, for example, in the equation: 2 + 3j: 2 is the real number, while
# 3 is the imaginary number, this happens because j = sqrt(-1).

#In the second part, I'll try to put two complex equations in the same plot.
